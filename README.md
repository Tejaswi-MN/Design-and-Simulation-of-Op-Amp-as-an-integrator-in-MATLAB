# Design-and-Simulation-of-Op-Amp-as-an-integrator-in-MATLAB
An inverting summing amplifier with more than two inputs combines multiple input signals into a single output, scaling and inverting them. Using an operational amplifier (op-amp) in the inverting configuration, resistors \(R_1, R_2, \ldots, R_n\) connect the input voltages \(V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_n\) to the inverting input.
